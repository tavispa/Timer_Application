My contributions to this project involved developing the layout for the timer GUI and locating resources for us to use to develop in QT.
I also attempted to manage the repo but we had some problems with it where we couldn't it to sync correctly so we often did things through
dropbox instead.  
I wrote prototype code in C and Qt's C++ to demonstrate the single timer application.
I wrote the code for the single timer application and made the decisions on the GUI architecture, and decided on its limitations for the scope of this project.

I also tried to update the README as feedback was received.
