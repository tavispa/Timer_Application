A Timer application with three options.    


In order to properly compile this program in a linux environment you must install the qt4 libraries if 
they are not already on your system.  To do this run this command from the terminal:

sudo apt-get install libxtst-dev build-essential libqt4-dev qt4-qmake


To create the executable for the main directory run:

make

The executable for the TIMER will be called timer.


To clean the *.o, moc*, and Makefile from the timerGUI directory run:

make clean


To Execute from command line:

./timer [version option] [# of timers]
