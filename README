A Timer application with three options.    


In order to properly compile this program in a linux environment you must install the qt4 libraries if 
they are not already on your system.  To do this run this command from the terminal:

sudo apt-get install libxtst-dev build-essential libqt4-dev qt4-qmake


To create the executable for the main directory run:

make

The executable for the TIMER will be called timer.


To clean the *.o, moc*, and Makefile from the timerGUI directory run:

make clean


To Execute from command line:

./timer [version option] [# of timers]

version options:
1 - stand alone console timer (No GUI)
2 - stand alone GUI timer
3 - Timer that takes console input and outputs via GUI timer

# of timers:
Number of timers needed (must be between 1 and 10)


Version 1 instructions:
NOTE:If you do not enter the time in the correct format, you will get a basic_string error. 


User will be prompted to enter events and time for each event, the time must 
be entered in the following format:

HH:MM:SS

User will be notified how long before the next event needs to be started and 
notified again when to start that event

If you use multiple timers, enter the events beginning at the LAST event:
For example, You want to cook 3 items, meat, potatoes, and corn.
Corn takes 10 seconds, potatoes takes 20 seconds, and meat takes 1 minute.
Run this command:
./timer 1 3

You will be prompted to 'enter timed event' and 'enter time needed.'  Do this as follows:
Enter timed event: corn
Enter time needed for corn: 00:00:10
Enter timed event: potatoes
Enter time needed for potatoes: 00:00:20
Enter timed event: meat
Enter time needed for meat: 00:01:00




Version 2 instructions:

There are two buttons in the main window.  The single timer button lauches a window that has a single count up or 
count down timer.  There are two options to choose  what will occur when the timer finishes.  The dependent timer button launches
a new timer that has dependencies. There is a About button for user instructions.
